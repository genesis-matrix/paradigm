    - on Collected Anecdotes
      - inspect "taste" the data to make sure you understand the shape and operate on the correct element. Not all assumption are safe.
      - employ =unless= and =creates= state clauses as simple guards to make states safer
      - there are levels of rigorous correctness in state-craft,
      - understand, appreciate, and communicate the expected use of a solution. A solution can always be adapted if needed, and this is a beautiful thing but not every one-off solution needs to be bullet-proof.
      - using the appropriate rigor in state-craft is virtuous because productivity is virtuous
      - using the highest rigor when the lowest rigor is appropriate may not be virtuous because it may not be productive
      - sustained practice in rigorous state-craft over time greatly lowers the difficulty of applying rigor, such that it's productive to apply rigor to increasingly trivial solutions, (DONT EXPECT THIS FROM LEARNERS!)
      - a casual solution, (perhaps something in Vestibule), that becomes more broadly useful should be "promoted" in a way that denotes a higher expectation of rigor. This can be a fork and doesn't necessarily even need to change the original at all.
      - promoting a casual or individual solution to a team solution, or a team solution into the a "base" sls module should be a shared decision. It involves renegociating risk exposure and risk migitation, so the shared costs and shared benefits should always be clear to those involved. These are decisions of shared 
      - there's nothing implicitly wrong or unvirtuous w/ shelling-out, it's just typically harder to test and less portable, this should be understood and appreciated (in some cases as technical debt) but this is normal and certainly not disqualifying for a well-organized team 
      - when using the =pkg.uptodate= state, the value of the =name= clause is still required, but it's not used for anything. This seems to operate differently between SLS and the CLI but remember that a value for =name= is always required, it's just that if you omit the name argument in SLS the function uses the SLS's ID value, but this doesn't happen on the command line. A value is required, but most any value, including an empty string ("") is accepted.

    - on Initial Understanding a/o Discovery
      - 
    - on the GeMa Convention for SLS Files
      - This is one area of the GeMa paradigm that isn't fully landed, but I can offer some additional insight to the design goals and trade offs involved.
      - I expect this area will eventually be rigorously define by GeMa paradigm.
      - By way of explanation, you'll sometime see me favor a small number of nested variables in an SLS. This serves to organize data along more than one dimension, (structure, in addition to purpose), and to limit the number of top-level objects to track in the SLS namespace.
      - Consider for example, that you're inheriting responsibility for a large collection of states from someone. If there is a single variable that serves as an entrypoint for the data significant to each SLS then you can know where to start to more easily discover what data is provided, and how the parts of that data might correlate to each other ... all without having to have a list of the variables in context.
      - There's also the possibility that some data operations could be automated, or further templatized by starting with a pre-established common name.

    - on the =var_dct= Variable
      - Variable naming is often caught triangulating among two or more ideals.
      - You could make this variable more descriptively named and shed the generic name of "var".
      - Using a =var_dct=, with a terse descriptive name.

     - on Initial Understanding a/o Discovery
       - the pillar_gitfs module uses the gitfs_utils to clone a remote repo to a cache dir then configure and query it using the local pillar_roots equivalent functions
       - the gitstack ext_pillar is evaluated _after_ the pillar_gits ext_pillar and so re-uses the local pillar_roots config for itself then pulls in and invokes the pillarstack ext_pillar module using the pillar_roots provided from pillar_gits as pillarstack's local pillar_roots
       - it should be possible to create a new ext_pillar module, which pulls in the pillar_gitfs module and subsequently pass the generated pillar_roots to the pillarstack module
         - this would lay the groundwork for adding gitfs support to pillarstack as a PR
       - Request: the pillar_gitfs should be refactored to seperate into worker functions called from the ext_pillar function, this would allow DRY re-use of the git-transparent pillar functionality in custom modules that want to similarly operate on git-backed pillar data

Vagrant, it’s not just for software developers. Learn how to “vagrant up” a network development environment. Useful for testing APIs, writing scripts, or exploring Ansible, Puppet, Salt, etc! This module will help you add some serious developer cred to your approach to NetDevOps and network development by building familiarity with the OpenSource tool Vagrant. It can be used to quickly “up” networking platforms on your laptop for fast development, code testing, API exploration and more! In this session we’ll cover the basics of using Vagrant, focusing on the networking elements of managing interfaces, protocols, and automating the initial provisioning with another OpenSource tool, Ansible. Leave with everything you need to get started today!
